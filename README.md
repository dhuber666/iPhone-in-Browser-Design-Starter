## Simple iPhone Design Component where you can try to design an app without react native or just play around

**Usage:**

- Import the APP Component and wrap your own components in it: like `<IPhone color="red"><CustomComp /></IPhone>`
- Or clone the repo and create components and place it into the `App.js` Component. 
- It's just a styled wrapper that gives you a iphone looking wrapper around your styles.
